## What is Exnihilo Science?

Exnihilo Science is a bold, foundational framework proposing that **everything — including matter, energy, intelligence, and space-time — emerged from absolute Nothingness (∅)**. This is not metaphorical or poetic: it is a symbolic and philosophical system built on the idea that true Nothing is unstable and thus **spontaneously gives rise to emergent structured phenomena**.

At its core lies the concept of **Nulljection** — the instability of Nothing leading to the emergence of symbolic “Anshes” (∞ₐ), which recursively interact, fade, and form structured symbolic forms (Sn, Sx), simulating the process of existence formation and even **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**.

## Key Concepts

- **∅ (Absolute Nothing)** — Not emptiness, not vacuum; true absence of all laws and structures.
- **Nulljection (∅⇌)** — A symbolic operation representing the lawless instability of Nothing.
- **Anshes (∞ₐ)** — Spontaneously emerging symbolic entities from ∅, leading to structure.
- **Sₙ / Sₓ** — Symbolic structured states resulting from the interaction of Anshes.
- **ƒₙ (Fade)** — Symbolic entropy and dissolution of structured states.
- **AGI Implication** — The theory demonstrates how self-perceiving symbolic agents could emerge from recursive instability, offering a **new model for artificial consciousness**.

## Why This Theory Matters

- It tackles the deepest question in metaphysics: **"Why is there something rather than nothing?"**
- Bridges **symbolic mathematics, cosmology, and AI theory** in a unified framework.
- Demonstrates symbolic **AGI potential** with actual simulation test results.
- Offers a **pre-physics layer** — a model of what could come *before* time, matter, and space.

## How to Get Involved

1. **Read the main PDF** to understand the symbolic system and philosophical logic.
2. **Run the Nulljection simulation** using Python or IBM Quantum Composer.
3. Share feedback, fork this theory, and explore ways to apply it in:
   - Artificial General Intelligence
   - Cosmological modeling
   - Symbolic computing
   - Creative philosophy

## Simulate Nulljection Now

You can try the Exnihilo Simulation in:

- **Python (using Qiskit)**
- **IBM Quantum Composer (free online quantum simulator)**
- **Browser-based symbolic engines (coming soon)**

A basic simulation lets you apply a Hadamard gate (H) to model Nulljection, showing spontaneous emergence of “Ansh” states from Nothing (∅).
